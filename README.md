<h1>What is Github Io</h1>
<p>Beginning today, all GitHub Pages sites are moving to a new, dedicated. domain: github.io. This is a security measure aimed at removing potential. vectors for cross domain attacks targeting the main github.com session as well. as vectors for phishing attacks relying on the presence of the <a href="https://github.com">"github.com"</a>
